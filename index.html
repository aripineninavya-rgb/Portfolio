                My career journey started with a strong interest in design and problem-solving, which led me to study UI/UX design at Tecvinson Academy. 
                During this time, I learned to create user-centered designs, build wireframes, and develop interactive prototypes using Figma and other tools. 
                These projects gave me confidence in understanding user needs and translating them into intuitive digital experiences.

                To expand my skills beyond design and to create complete products, 
            I have now joined a Frontend Development course at Sundsgården Folkhögskola. My goal is to combine creative design skills 
            with technical development skills, enabling me to build applications that are not only visually engaging but also functional and accessible.
